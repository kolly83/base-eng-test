# Cloud Systems Engineering Tests

## Scope of Work
Deploy a simple python application to AWS that responds to HTTP POST requests and returns a JSON response.
All resources need to be provisioned using Terraform and state managed through Terraform Cloud.

High level objectives: 
- Configure a pipeline in Github actions and deploy the packaged python code. (CircleCi can be used if Github actions is not preferred)
- Authenticate with AWS (Applicants choice)
- Review and deploy the Terraform configuration to provision the required resources.
- Display proper Terraform state management through Terraform Cloud.
- Provide the API endpoint URL to the deployed application.

### Prerequisites
- Credentials to sandbox AWS account will be provided to you.
- Github (or other VCS provider supported by CircleCI) account
- CircleCI account (If Github is not preferred)
- Python3 (At least version 3.10)
- Pipenv
- AWS Boto3 (at least version 1.26.0)
- AWS CLI
- Terraform (At least version 1.5.0)
- Terraform Cloud Account (TFC provide a free tier)


### Deployment Success Criteria
Deployment is largely up to the applicant on how to execute this.
Below are the basic rquirements:
- The fundamental requirement is to successfully complete provisioning and deployment using Terraform.
- Deployment should be achieved through a chosen pipeline, using best practices.
- Test and validate terraform configuration before applying.
- Correctly package and deploy the code to a Lambda function. The type of Lambda function is up to the applicant. (Zip archive, container, etc.)
- The function should be able to respond to HTTP POST requests and return a JSON response.
- Deployment pipeline should be able to update the Lambda function with new code changes.
